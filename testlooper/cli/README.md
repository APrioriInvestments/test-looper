# Testlooper Command Line Interface (tlcli)

`tlcli` is a command-line tool that enables performing common Testlooper tasks locally.



### Autocomplete

Auto complete for Bash, Zsh and ,Fish is supported out-of-the-box.
For Bash and Zsh you must "source" the file `tlcli-autocomplete.XXXX`
(where XXXX is `bash` or `zsh`) in this directory.
You can do that in `~/.bashrc` for Bash and `~/.zshrc` for Zsh.

For Fish, you must copy `tlcli-autocomplete.fish` to `~/.config/fish/completions/tlcli.fish`.
